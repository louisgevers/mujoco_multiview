# MuJoCo MultiView

A multi-window viewer for MuJoCo with user study rendering tools.

Enables viewing the scene from multiple camera angles, enabling user study scenarios where multiple users interact within the same simulation, but require different visual feedbacks.
The viewer is implemented in C++ and can be run passively in the background from Python (going around the limitations of the GIL).
